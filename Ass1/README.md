# CMSC5728 Programming Assignment #1

A program (with its input file) which can calculate the confidence interval of 
the above 3 cases.

For this task, you can just run the `case.py`, where you can adjust the parameters to decide whether to regenerate the numbers or not.

```shell
python case.py
```

For visualization, because of too much data files if I generate them in different files, I just save a temp file for usage. So I didn't put it here. 

For firstly running, you need to set the parameter `if_regen` with `True` in function `uni_distribution_2range`.

```shell
python visualization.py
```
